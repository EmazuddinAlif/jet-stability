This repository contains all the files and codes pertaining to the paper "**Liquid jet stability through elastic planar nozzles**" (https://doi.org/10.1140/epjs/s11734-022-00656-w). Please contact Md. Emazuddin Alif (malif@vols.utk.edu) or Dr. Andrew Dickerson (adicker7@utk.edu) for further details and information.

## CAD Models and Descriptions
- Base_plate.ipt : Base plate along which the linear stage connected to the relaxation chamber is held
- Connector_ring : 3D printed ring connecting the relaxation chamber to the membrane. On later iterations it was replaced with metallic flanges sourced from Home Depot
- encoder_coupler.ipt : Couples the encoder to the linear stage moving the relaxation chamber
- encoder_mount.ipt: Mounts the rotary encoder on the base plate
- Relaxation chamber holder.ipt : Connects the relaxation chamber to the linear stage
- Relaxation chamber outer holder.ipt : Clamps the relaxation chamber to the Relaxation Chamber Holder
- punch_holder.ipt : Holds the punch parallel to vertical in order to create clean circular nozzles
- laminizer.rld : Laminarizes the flow inside the relaxation chamber
